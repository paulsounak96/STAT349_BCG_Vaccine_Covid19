# Does BCG vaccine have a protective effect against severe COVID-19?
## Sounak Paul

It has been suspected since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, that the bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccine
might be providing some protection from the virus. The basis for this suspicion is primarily the observation
that countries which had a national BCG vaccination policy seem to have lower number of cases and deaths
per million people. The paper titled ”BCG vaccine protection from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19)” by Escobar et al., which appeared in PNAS , (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008410117) on October
12, 2020, claims that BCG policy and coverage indeed has a statistically significant effect on the number of
deaths per million in a country. In this project, I will comment on and criticize their methodology, and then
conduct a much more sophisticated statistical analysis incorporating spatial and/or temporal structure in
my models. In the end, I shall provide comments regarding reliability and other issues with my own analysis.

This was a course project for STAT 349 at UChicago.
